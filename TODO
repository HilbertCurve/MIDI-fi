I'm redoing everything; it doesn't make sense to have a music-editing
project be based off a game engine.  The following roadmap is a prototype.

Audio:
    AudioMaster.cpp:
        [ ] OpenAL system - opening audio devices and such
        [ ] WAV files
        [ ] OGG files
        mp3? MIDI at some point
    AudioUtils.cpp:
        [ ] Audio playback
        [ ] Audio streaming
        [ ] Audio recording
        Audio effects? pitch, gain, reverb, etc. ???

Core:
    Input.cpp:
        [+] Mouse - position, scroll, buttons
        [+] Keyboard - keys, modifiers?
    Application.cpp:
        [ ] Runtime info
        [+] GLFW window
        a scene is a collection of UI elements
        [ ] Scenes
    Memory.cpp:
        [ ] Pre-allocated arenas for buffers & UI elements
        [ ] Dumps - append-only vectors
        [ ] Vectors and Lists

Graphics:
    Graphics.cpp:
        [ ] Shaders
        [ ] Framebuffers
        [ ] Camera - units will be measured in pixels
        [ ] Complex renderable primitives
        [ ] Buffers - I might use the rData system
        [ ] OpenGL textures
        [ ] IconMaps
    Font.cpp:
        [ ] Font loading
        [ ] Font texture generation
        [ ] CORRECT UVs FOR FONTS!
        

UI:
    a file for each element
    [ ] Text elements
    [ ] Text boxes
    [ ] Buttons
    [ ] Scrollbars
    [ ] Checkmarks
    [ ] UI themes
    UI element composition:
        [ ] Relative element positioning
        [ ] Ownership system
    MIDI-editor:
        [ ] Grid
        [ ] Piano overlay
        [ ] Notes
    UI (de)serialization:
        [ ] Some form of XML parser; probably 3rd party
        [ ] XML serialization
        [ ] XML deserialization

MIDI utils:
    [ ] MIDI serialization
    [ ] MIDI deserialization
    [ ] MIDI playback
